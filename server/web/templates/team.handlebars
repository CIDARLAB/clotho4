                                Doug was the original creator of Clotho when he was a UC Chancellorâ€™s post doctoral fellow at UC Berkeley. He also served as the research advisor for the 2008, 2009, and 2011 Clotho iGEM teams. He is is a Kern Faculty Fellow, a Hariri Institute for Computing and Computational Science and Engineering Junior Faculty Fellow, and Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Boston University. His research focuses on the development of tools for the specification, design, and assembly of synthetic biological systems, drawing upon his experience with embedded system level design and electronic design automation (EDA). He received his B.S.E in Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan and his M.S. and PhD in Electrical Engineering from UC Berkeley. He is the director of the Cross-disciplinary Integration of Design Automation Research (CIDAR) group at Boston University.

                                Chris leads the Anderson Lab to resolve bottleneck steps in the design and implementation of genetic engineering projects. Currently the lab is focused on developing the Clotho and Act Synthesizer tools, multiplex characterize technologies, and formal solutions to biosafety problems. He is an Associate professor of bioengineering at UC Berkeley. His research is developing the foundational technologies and applications for synthetic biology, with a emphasis on advanced DNA assembly, computer-aided manufacture, and therapeutic organisms. He joined the UC Berkeley faculty in 2007 after earning a Ph.D from the Scripps Research Institute and pursuing postdoctoral work at UC Berkeley. His work was recognized by Technology Review with the TR35 Award in 2007 and by Synthetic Biology 2.0 with its Best Application Award in 2006.
